==========

Block Reference creates a field that references several blocks. A default value can be set.
This module restricts the field it references by using the default block and then
content editor can just toggle that one block to show or hide for a given node.

ISSUES
==================
Block Reference has an issue (June 17, 2014) with the autocomplete widget. See https://www.drupal.org/node/2287641.
Hence, support is only available for select list and checkboxes widget.


COMPATIBILITY NOTES
==================
- Compatible only with Block Reference 2.0, not 1.0
